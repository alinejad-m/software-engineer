# PostgreSQL Indexes Guide

This directory contains comprehensive documentation about different types of indexes in PostgreSQL, their use cases, and implementation details.

## Index Types Overview

1. [B-tree Indexes](01-b-tree.md)
   - Default index type in PostgreSQL
   - Suitable for equality and range queries
   - Supports sorting and uniqueness constraints
   - Best for columns with high cardinality

2. [Unique Indexes](02-unique.md)
   - Ensures data uniqueness
   - Automatically created for PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE constraints
   - Can be combined with partial indexes
   - Supports multiple columns

3. [Hash Indexes](03-hash.md)
   - Optimized for equality operations
   - Smaller than B-tree for simple equality queries
   - Cannot handle range queries
   - Good for memory-resident lookup tables

4. [GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)](04-gin.md)
   - Perfect for full-text search
   - Handles array and jsonb data types
   - Efficient for multi-value columns
   - Good for "contains" queries

5. [GiST (Generalized Search Tree)](05-gist.md)
   - Suitable for geometric data types
   - Handles multi-dimensional data
   - Support for nearest-neighbor searches
   - Extensible index structure

6. [BRIN (Block Range INdex)](06-brin.md)
   - Designed for very large tables
   - Works well with naturally sorted data
   - Extremely space efficient
   - Perfect for time-series data

7. [Partial Indexes](07-partial.md)
   - Index only a subset of rows
   - Reduced storage and maintenance overhead
   - Optimized for specific WHERE conditions
   - Combines with other index types

8. [Covering Indexes](08-covering.md)
   - Includes all columns needed by query
   - Eliminates table lookups
   - Improves query performance
   - Perfect for read-heavy workloads

## Quick Reference Guide

### When to Use Each Index Type

| Index Type | Best For | Use Cases |
|------------|----------|----------|
| B-tree | General purpose, ordered data | Primary keys, unique constraints, range queries |
| Unique | Enforcing uniqueness | Email addresses, usernames, product codes |
| Hash | Equality comparisons | Simple key-value lookups, in-memory tables |
| GIN | Complex data types | Full-text search, array operations, JSON queries |
| GiST | Geometric/spatial data | Geographic queries, nearest neighbor searches |
| BRIN | Large sequential data | Time-series data, log tables, sensor data |
| Partial | Subset of rows | Active records, filtered queries, specific conditions |
| Covering | Read-heavy operations | API endpoints, reporting queries, frequent lookups |

### Performance Considerations

- **Storage Overhead**: BRIN < Hash < B-tree < GiST < GIN < Covering
- **Write Performance**: BRIN > Partial > B-tree > Hash > GiST > GIN
- **Read Performance**: Covering > B-tree > Hash > GIN > GiST > BRIN
- **Maintenance Cost**: BRIN < Partial < Hash < B-tree < GiST < GIN

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Index**
   - Consider query patterns
   - Evaluate data characteristics
   - Balance performance vs. overhead
   - Test with realistic data volumes

2. **Monitor and Maintain**
   - Regular VACUUM and ANALYZE
   - Monitor index usage
   - Review query plans
   - Clean up unused indexes

3. **Optimize for Workload**
   - Read vs. write ratio
   - Query complexity
   - Data volume and growth
   - Storage constraints
